# scrabble
Scrabble task - 4th year project
Aim of the project is to measure how aesthetics in user interfaces can effect task performance.

The application is written in Java and allows users to perform several scrabble tasks. The task performance - how many valid words they entered in the given time is then stored to be analysed out with the program.

There are 3 types of experiments that the application can be used for - colour, shape and layout.
